- Converting an integer to a string to process then converting it back will lose all leading 0s (if any). For example, in a function to shift the digits in a number left or right, we convert it to string for easy processing, but if the result is `"0012345"`, converting it back to a integer will drop the 2 leading 0s, resulting in `12345` instead of `0012345`
