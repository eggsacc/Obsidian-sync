- The property that the result produced by a function remains the same regardless of the order of inputs is called commutativity, or order invariance. I.e. `foo([a, b, c]) = foo([b, c, a])`
- The iterator objects returned by functions like map, filter etc. are not the same as lists or tuples. For example: `map(lambda x: x, [1, 2, 3]) == [1, 2, 3] # False`
