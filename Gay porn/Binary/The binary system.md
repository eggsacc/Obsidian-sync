# The decimal system

The number system all too familiar to us humans is known as the decimal, or base-10 system. It is a base-10 system since there are 10 distinct digits (0-9) that could be used to represent a number. 

In a number with multiple digits, the rightmost (last) digit represents $10^1$, and each digit towards the left represented a higher power of 10, e.g 2nd digit from right represents $10^2$ , 3rd digit represents $10^3$ etc.
