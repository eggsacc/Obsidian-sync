## Heading 


  
FWIW, I disagree (in that I don't think what you suggest is accurate for all users). I'm in my 50s now and I spent most of my time writing software. Now if I have my 3240x2160 monitor about 33" away, I find it much better to have clean glyphs, not ones with fancy flourishes or serifs (and I sure as heck want to be able to distinguish capital I and lower case L and the number 1 and separately I need to distinguish the number zero from the letter capital O).

A lot of us that were in the first generation of frequent availability of computers are now heading into the age bracket where serif fonts are not helping us. Neither are IDEs that can't scale their menus and so on without wanting to blow up the entire app.....
