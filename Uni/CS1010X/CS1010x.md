## Slicing

When given something like `'banananananananab'[:6]`, python slices the character array from the start to (but excluding) the element at index 6.

If the step size if negative **and** and start index is unspecified, such as `'banananananananab'[:6:-1]`, python will default from slicing from the end of the list due to the negative step size.

However, if the start index is specified, e.g. `'banananananananab'[0:6:-1]`, nothing is printed since python tries to start and index 0 and reach index 6 while moving backwards.

This only happens if the step size if specified to be negative and the starting index is not specified or after the end index.

So in the case of slicing from `[:-5]`, python will assume a step size of 1 and slice from the beginning till (but excluding) the 5th element from the end.

Also, if we start somewhere at the end and move backwards, it will slice from the starting position downwards until (but excluding) the end index.

````python
print('banananananananab'[-2:6:-1])
            # anananana
````

Hence, a character array could be reversed by using `char_arr[::-1]`.

Multiple slicing operations could also be performed in succession: `char_arr[::2][::-1]` takes the alternating characters in the original array, then reverses their sequence.

Also, slicing is a graceful operation in python, meaning that slicing beyond the limits of an array, string or tuple actually does not raise an error. Instead, the slicing operation gracefully handles it by stopping at the end of the list.

## Comparing strings / characters

When we compare characters, such as `return ('A' > 'B')`, the ASCII encoding values of each character is compared. In the case above, the ASCII value of 'A' is 65 while 'B' is 66, hence it evaluates to `False`.

However, when comparing a string, such as `'abcd' > 'lopid'`, python does not compare the sum of all the ASCII values in each string. Instead, it compares each character in a lexicographical manner. The comparison terminates once one character in any position is larger / lower than the other; if they are equal, it moves on to the next character, and if both string have the same characters, the shorter string would be considered smaller.


## Weird tuples

Given the statement `1 > 10,000`, python will output `(False, 0)`! This is because the comma separates the statement up into a tuple, read as `(1 > 10, 000)`, which evaluates to `(False, 0)`.

Another example is `1, 2, 3 > 4, 5, 6`, python will output `(1, 2, False, 5, 6)`.


## Exponents

Exponents are evaluated from **right to left**. So given the statement `2**3**4`, python will evaluate it as $2^{3^{4}}$.


## Logic operator precedence

Given the statement `2 < 3 < 6 > 1`, python does an implicit `and` operation; it evaluates each logical comparator and returns `True` only if all the conditions are `True`, else `False`.

Also, the `and` operator always takes precedence upon `or`. So given the statement `2 and 3 or 4`, python evaluates the `and` statement first, which is `True`, so it returns the latter (last True) value, 3.

Another example is `0 or 3 and 2`; the `3 and 2` part is evaluated first, which is `True`, hence it evaluates to `2` which is the last `True` expression.


## Weird if-else behavior

Since python is an interpreted language, given an `if else` statement, the un-executed branch can contain errors but python will not raise it up since it is not being executed.

For example, 
````python
if True:
	print(0)
else:
	abc-efg
````

Python will happily print 0 and ignore the pretty obvious error in the `else` statement since the `else` branch if not executed.

Also, just a side note, the `abc-efg` part is interpreted as `abc - efg`. So if some variables `abc` and `efg` exists, it will return the latter subtracted from the former.

## Boolean behavior

The expression `bool(x)` returns if `x` is `True` or `False`.

Any non-zero expression will evaluate to `True`. For example: `bool(0.1), bool(3), bool(-139), bool('a')` all evaluates to `True`. However, due to the limited precision of floating point numbers (due to how computers store decimals), something like 

`bool(0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001)` 

actually evaluates to `False` since the computer approximates the very small number to 0.

## Tuples

Tuples are immutable. If we try to change a tuple, we get an error. If we try to re-assign a tuple, the original value is actually left behind and the variable name is now bound to another location in memory containing the new tuple:

````python
a = (1, 3)
b = (a, 5)

a = (2, 4)
print(b)
# b is still ((1, 3), 5)
````

Tuples also behave somewhat like strings: the + operator concatenates 2 tuples.

````python
a = (1, 3)
b = (2, 4)
c = a + b # c is (1, 3, 2, 4)
````

Tuples could also be sliced like strings.

````python
a = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
print(a[::2]) # skip every other element, returns ('a', 'c', 'e')
````

Tuples can only be concatenated with other tuples. To concatenate another value with a tuple, we need to write it as `tup + (val, )`.

Tuple method time complexities:
- Slicing: O(n) since a new tuple has to be created, and since tuples can store heterogeneous types, the elements has to be copied 1 by 1.
- Accessing any element: O(1)

## Iterators

Some python functions return an iterator instead of a list of tuple. These functions include (but not limited to) `map`, `accumulate` etc. 

An iterator behaves like a exhaustive list. After accessing the elements in an iterator, it is deleted.

The elements has to be accessed in sequence starting from the first element, and we cannot access random elements within a iterator since it is not subscriptable. For example:

````python
a = map(lambda x: x*x, (1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
print(a[2])
````

will return an error instead of printing the element at index 2.

````python
for item in a:
	print(item)
````

Will print out all the elements within the iterator and empty it. So if we tried to print the elements in `a` again, it will output nothing.

The `next()` function is used to access the next element in an iterator and delete it.

>[!Important]
>The `map()` function returns a iterator! It must be cast to a `tuple` or `list` to be processed/stored.
